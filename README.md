      Repeat Schedules
      A schedule is a string in the format YYYY-MM-DD [0-6] which is compared to
      the current local date and day of the week. If the comparison succeeds, any
      "done" task is flipped back to "open". The wildcard % may also be used.
      
        %          every day
        %-07-04 %  every July 4th
        % 1        every Monday
      
      The repeat command accepts multiple schedules for a task, so to repeat task
      50 on Saturdays and Sundays:
      
        oy r 50 '% 6' '% 0'
